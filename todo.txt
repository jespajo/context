Amalgamate find_block and add_block functions

Test out removing zero_alloc---do we actually need it or is memset enough?

Rename alloc -> alloc_ etc. and create externally linked versions that assert they have a non-null context

Split up create_context and create_top_context

Cleanup assert_context_makes_sense()

Just have DEBUG/NDEBUG, not both
